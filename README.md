# QT_Countries

## Course work for 5G00BD72-3006 Graphical User Interfaces

In order to gain better grasp of QT and its possibilities, I made this small program that lists most of the worlds countries and areas.
You can view simple data about these and compare them against each other. 

The data was sampled from Fernando Lasso's [Kagle data](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world) and others. 


The flags were provided by [flagpedia.net]( https://flagpedia.net)
